Welcome to our final year project made by a marvelous team of engineers. The code is only hosted by me here on behalf of everyone.

## Purpose

This project transforms website text into tactile Braille in real time for visually and auditory impaired
users. A Python script scrapes text from a given URL and sends it to an Arduino, which uses servo motors
to raise and lower pins to form 3x2 Braille cells. Each letter appears sequentially on a tactile display, enabling interactive, accessible reading
